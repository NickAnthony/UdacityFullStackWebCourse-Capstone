# UdacityFullStackWebCourse-Capstone Frontend

The app is live at: https://nickanthony-casting-agency.herokuapp.com/

## Javascript Code Style

All react/javascript files have been checked with `eslint`.  Please see
https://eslint.org/ for more information.  It follows the Google style guide
defaults.

Using the following to double check code style:

```Shell
npx eslint <filename.js> --fix
```

### PropTypes

All components that take props all need to use PropTypes to type check the
props.  See https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html for
more detailed information.
